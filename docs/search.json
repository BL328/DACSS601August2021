All files can be found in the _data folder on the course blog. Note that some of these datasets require significant wrangling/cleaning. Also note that any .xls/.xlsx files may have multiple sheets, so it will be helpful to open these files in a spreadsheet software first, to examine the file you are reading in.\nHotel Bookings\nThis dataset contains hotel bookings from 2015-2017. Each row is an individual hotel booking. The file is named hotel_bookings.csv. Because the file format is .csv, we can use the function read_csv() from the readr package to read in the data to R.\n\n\nhotels <- read_csv(here(\"_data\",\"hotel_bookings.csv\"))\nhotels\n\n\n# A tibble: 119,390 × 32\n   hotel        is_canceled lead_time arrival_date_ye… arrival_date_mo…\n   <chr>              <dbl>     <dbl>            <dbl> <chr>           \n 1 Resort Hotel           0       342             2015 July            \n 2 Resort Hotel           0       737             2015 July            \n 3 Resort Hotel           0         7             2015 July            \n 4 Resort Hotel           0        13             2015 July            \n 5 Resort Hotel           0        14             2015 July            \n 6 Resort Hotel           0        14             2015 July            \n 7 Resort Hotel           0         0             2015 July            \n 8 Resort Hotel           0         9             2015 July            \n 9 Resort Hotel           1        85             2015 July            \n10 Resort Hotel           1        75             2015 July            \n# … with 119,380 more rows, and 27 more variables:\n#   arrival_date_week_number <dbl>, arrival_date_day_of_month <dbl>,\n#   stays_in_weekend_nights <dbl>, stays_in_week_nights <dbl>,\n#   adults <dbl>, children <dbl>, babies <dbl>, meal <chr>,\n#   country <chr>, market_segment <chr>, distribution_channel <chr>,\n#   is_repeated_guest <dbl>, previous_cancellations <dbl>,\n#   previous_bookings_not_canceled <dbl>, reserved_room_type <chr>, …\n\nSource: https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand\nAlso see the link for a detailed key.\n2019 New York City Air BnB Bookings\nThis dataset contains Air Bnb bookings from 2019 in New York City. Each row contains an individual Air Bnb listing, and each column contains information about it (e.g., number of reviews per month, price, data of last review). The file is named AB_NYC_2019.csv. Because the file format is .csv, we can use the function read_csv() from the readr package to read in the data to R.\n\n\nair_bnb <- read_csv(here(\"_data\",\"AB_NYC_2019.csv\"))\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data\nAlso see the link for a detailed key.\n2017 Austrailian Marriage Law\nData on public opinion of a proposed same sex marriage law in Australia in 2017. The file is called australian_marriage_law_postal_survey_2017_-_response_final.xlsx, so we can use the function read_excel() to read in the data. However, this dataset was designed as an Excel spreadsheet, and so will take some extra work to be read into R.\nSource: https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1800.0\nDOD Active Duty Marital Status\nCount data on various demographic charasterics, notably marital status and child status, by pay grade, for multiple branches of the military (as well as DOD as a whole). This file is called ActiveDuty_MaritalStatus.xls. However, this dataset was designed as an Excel spreadsheet, and so will take some extra work to be read into R.\nSource: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/active-duty-marital-status/resource/638cad03-b16c-48ac-8346-f858ff89d202\nPublic School Characteristics 2017-2018\nData on characteristics of every US public school from 2017-2018. File is called Public_School_Characteristics_2017-18.csv. Note that this file is fairly large, and if you aren’t careful, you may encounter parsing errors when reading in the file.\nSource: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/public-school-characteristics-2017-18\n2012 US Railroad Employment.\nData breaking down US railroad employment numbers in 2012 by state and county.

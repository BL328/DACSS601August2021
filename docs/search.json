All files can be found in the _data folder on the course blog. Note that some of these datasets require significant wrangling/cleaning. Also note that any .xls/.xlsx files may have multiple sheets, so it will be helpful to open these files in a spreadsheet software first, to examine the file you are reading in.\nAlso note that there are both basic and advanced versions of the datasets. The basic versions are clean and can be read into R fairly easily. These are great to practice on if you are new to R or need a refresher on importing data. For those who are more advanced R programmers, the advanced datasets will require significant work to be imported into R and tidied.\nHotel Bookings\nThis dataset contains hotel bookings from 2015-2017. Each row is an individual hotel booking. This dataset is only available as an advanced dataset. The file is named hotel_bookings.csv.

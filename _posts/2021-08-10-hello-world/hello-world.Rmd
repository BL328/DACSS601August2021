Hi folks! My name is Marina. I will now try to make R do something

### What does the UCB Admissions dataset look like?
```{r}
UCBAdmissions <- as.data.frame(UCBAdmissions)
head(UCBAdmissions)
```
### How many departments are in the dataset?
```{r}
table(UCBAdmissions$Dept)
```

### How many people were admitted across all departments?
```{r}
admitted <- subset(UCBAdmissions, Admit == "Admitted")
total <- sum(admitted$Freq)
print(paste("The sum of all admits is", total))
```
